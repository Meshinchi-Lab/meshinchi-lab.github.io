I am a Pediatric Oncologist and Physician-Scientist with a research focus on developing novel targeted therapies for high-risk leukemias, particularly AML. Using RNA sequencing data from over 3000 pediatric patients with AML, we are working to identify targets that are uniquely expressed in AML and not expressed on normal blood cells. Once we have identified an “AML-restricted” target, we then validate the expression of our target on AML cells and develop novel immunotherapies against our novel “AML-restricted targets”. Using our novel immunotherapies, specifically CAR T cells and CAR NK cells, we conduct all pre-clinical studies including evaluating our novel targeted therapies using in vitro and in vivo models with the goal to translate these novel immunotherapies into clinical trials for our high-risk AML patients who currently have poor outcomes with high rates of relapse. Being able to conduct translational research for our highest risk patients while also caring for these patients is a truly remarkable and rewarding experience. When I am not in the lab or clinic, I love spending time with my husband and 2 children exploring the beautiful outdoors in the PNW, traveling, cooking and relaxing.
