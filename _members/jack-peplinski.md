I'm interested in using large datasets to improve patient outcomes in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. Some of my work involves working on our [laboratory shiny app](https://meshinchi-data-viz.fredhutch.org/) and creating a [shiny app for risk visualization](https://vizrisk.fredhutch.org/). Data visualization is a critical component of scientific communication and is a major focus of my work. I also write bioinformatics pipelines and perform data analysis using R, Python, and Bash. I use a variety of omics approaches and data types such as bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, whole-genome sequencing, and clinical data and strongly believe in the value of taking a multi-omic approach to answering complex questions in a disease as heterogeneous as AML. I am from Beaverton, Oregon and enjoy watching and playing tennis and soccer.
