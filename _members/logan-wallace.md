As a bioinformatician in the Meshinchi lab, my work focuses on interogating our large collection of multi-omic data to try and understand the underlying abberations that lead to leukemogenesis. To do this, I use computational tools and my background in molecular biology and genomics to build data analysis pipelines, identify sequence variants, visualize multipatient sequencing data and lot's else. For me, bioinformatics exists at the perfect nexus of being able to address fundamental problems in biology with methods that are equally interesting.

When not coding, I'm typically finding a way to enjoy the great outdoors with my dog Keele. I love living in the Pacific Northwest and all the opportunities it provides to get outside!
