<!-- excerpt start -->
This year more than half of our lab members are riding or running in Fred Hutch's annual Obliteride! 
<!-- excerpt end -->
The Fred Hutch Obliteride is a bike ride and 5K walk/run that connects and empowers people to help cure cancer faster by raising funds for Fred Hutch Cancer Center. Every summer, Obliteriders of all ages come together to take action, honor loved ones, and rally their friends, family, and community to support Fred Hutch's mission. This year all donations made to our team or individual team members go toward supporting our lab directly!
