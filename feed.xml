Led by Soheil Meshinchi, M.D., Ph.D., our research laboratory is studying genomic expression of acute myeloid leukemia-restricted targets on the cell surface that are ideal for immunotherapeutic targeting with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapies, as well as identifying and validating target genes for further immunotherapy development.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Computational Work in The Meshinchi Lab</title><link href="/2024/07/18/Computational_Work_in_the_Meshinchi_Lab.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Computational Work in The Meshinchi Lab" /><published>2024-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-18T18:43:16+00:00</updated><id>/2024/07/18/Computational_Work_in_the_Meshinchi_Lab</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/07/18/Computational_Work_in_the_Meshinchi_Lab.html"><![CDATA[<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>The field of biology is firmly in the age of big data. The Meshinchi lab is only an exception in that we have even more data than nearly another other pediatric AML researchers on earth. This makes employing computational skills a critical part of nearly any research we undertake.
